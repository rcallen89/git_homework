“Society, as we have constituted it, will have no place for me, has none to
offer; but Nature, whose sweet rains fall on unjust and just alike, will have
clefts in the rocks where I may hide, and secret valleys in whose silence I
may weep undisturbed. She will hang the night with stars so that I may walk
abroad in the darkness without stumbling, and send the wind over my footprints
so that none may track me to my hurt: she will cleanse me in great waters,
and with bitter herbs make me whole.”

-Oscar Wilde
